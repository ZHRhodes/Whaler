## What is Whaler? 

Whaler is a platform consisting of a native mac app ([Whaler](https://github.com/ZHRhodes/Whaler)) and a heroku-hosted backend. The goal is to enable real time sales outreach collaboration right on top of the organization's Salesforce data. This is accomplished by allowing the user to sign in to their organization's Salesforce, importing subsets of their data into the frontend app, and enhancing that data with additional constructs that power our features. 

These features include: 
* Kanban-style progress tracking for accounts and contacts
* Per-account tasks feature with ability to create, edit, set due date, and complete tasks
* Assign accounts, contacts, and tasks to users within your organization
* Real time collaborative editor for account notes, communicating over websockets with operational transform conflict resolution
* Real time data model updates over websockets
